# 🚦 MargVedhaMain: Smart Urban Traffic Management System

A multi-layered, AI-powered solution aimed at optimizing public transportation through real-time traffic perception, dynamic routing, and agentic decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Urban public transport often suffers from:
- Long wait times
- Overcrowding
- Inefficiency
- Poor commuter experiences

MargVedhaMain introduces a **4-Layer AI Stack** to create a Smart, Real-Time Adaptive Transit Ecosystem.

## 🧠 System Architecture

```mermaid

    A[YOLOv8 Perception Layer: Detects vehicles, roadblocks, VIP movement] --> B[Agentic AI Core: Real-time traffic control and routing]
    B --> C[Supervisory AI: Validates actions and prevents misbehavior]
    C --> D[User & Authority Interface: App for location input and Admin Dashboard]
```

**Layers:**
- **YOLOv8 Perception**: Computer vision for traffic object and anomaly detection.
- **Agentic AI Core**: Autonomous traffic decision-making (signals, buses, taxis).
- **Supervisory AI**: Monitors and validates Agentic AI actions.
- **Interface Layer**: Web app for authorities, Android app for commuters.

    S["City/Smart Government Partnership"] --> A["Data Integration & Deployment: Sensors, CCTVs"]
    A --> B["Traffic & Transit Optimization Engine"]
    B --> C["Reduction in Travel Time, Emissions, and Congestion"]
    C --> D["Increased Public Transport Adoption"]
    D --> E["Revenue from Platform License, Data API, Dynamic Fare Model"]
```

**Revenue Streams:**
- City-level Platform Licensing (SaaS)
- Real-time Traffic Data APIs for urban planners
- Commissions from AI-powered Dynamic Fare System
